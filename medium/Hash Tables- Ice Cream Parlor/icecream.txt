Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool their money to buy ice cream. On any given day, the parlor offers a line of flavors. 
Each flavor has a cost associated with it.

Given the value of money and the cost of each flavor for t trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two distinct flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money 
during each visit. ID numbers are the 1- based index number associated with a cost. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny
 purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.
